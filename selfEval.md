# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

  * I am confident and aware of my time management in this assignment. I didn't spend too much time on the blocks I had today. I really tried to use my community to help me work through the assignments.


- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

  * I would tell them that this an answer I made to tell you when you ask different questions. So if I made a function about ages and names I would ask the 5 year old to ask me with any age and name and I would answer the question with my function. Such as, "(anyName) is (anyAge) years old" and if the child said 'Sarah and 7' then the answer to the question would be "Sarah is 7 years old". I have the answer to a question.


- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

  * My understanding is that a parameter is the part of the function that gets decided by the argument. Like, in the example in the lesson, makeDinner (genre), the parameter is the genre of the meal and the arguments of the function will be the kind of answers to the parameter. Such as mexican and itialian.


- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

  * I don't have any questions for my small group.
